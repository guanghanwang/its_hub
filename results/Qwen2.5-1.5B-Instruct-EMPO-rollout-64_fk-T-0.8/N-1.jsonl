We know that the total number of coins is 110. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[\nS + (S + 30) = 110\n\\]\n\n Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:\n\\[\n2S + 30 = 110\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to isolate \\( S \\). We do this by subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[\n2S = 80\n\\]\n\nThen, we divide both sides by 2:\n\\[\nS = 40\n\\]\n\nNow that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the number of gold coins by adding 30 to the number of silver coins:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of gold coins} = S + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of gold coins Gretchen has is \\(\\boxed{70}\\).","correct_argmax":true}
