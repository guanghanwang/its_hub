The number of worker bees is twice the number of babies. Therefore, the number of worker bees is \\( 2 \\times 2q = 4q \\).\n\nNow, we know the total number of bees in the hive is 700. This total consists of queens, babies, and worker bees. We can express this relationship with the equation:\n\\[ q + 2q + 4q = 700 \\]\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\\[ 7q = 700 \\]\nTo find the value of \\( q \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 7:\n\\[ q = \\frac{700}{7} = 100 \\]\nSo, the number of queens is 100. The number of babies is \\( 2q = 2 \\times 100 = 200 \\). The number of worker bees is \\( 4q = 4 \\times 100 = 400 \\).\n\nTherefore, the number of worker bees is \\(\\boxed{400}\\).","correct_argmax":true}

So, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   12 = 4 \\times S_o\n   \\]\n   To find \\( S_o \\), we solve for \\( S_o \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 4:\n   \\[\n   S_o = \\frac{12}{4} = 3\n   \\]\n   So, Sophia bought 3 onions.\n\n2. **Determine the number of potatoes Sophia bought:**\n   Similarly, Rose bought 4 times the number of potatoes that Sophia bought. Let's denote the number of potatoes Sophia bought as \\( S_p \\). According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought. Therefore, we can write:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of potatoes Rose bought} = 4 \\times \\text{Number of potatoes Sophia bought}\n   \\]\n   We know that Rose bought 4 potatoes. So, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   4 = 4 \\times S_p\n   \\]\n   To find \\( S_p \\), we solve for \\( S_p \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 4:\n   \\[\n   S_p = \\frac{4}{4} = 1\n   \\]\n   So, Sophia bought 1 potato.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought:**\n   The total number of onions Sophia bought is 3, and the total number of potatoes Sophia bought is 1. Therefore, the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is:\n   \\[\n   3 + 1 = 4\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).","correct_argmax":true}

Therefore, the number of cards Smendrick has is \\( 3p \\).\n\nBecca has 12 more cards than Smendrick. Therefore, the number of cards Becca has is \\( 3p + 12 \\).\n\nThe total number of cards among Becca, Smendrick, and PJ is given as 341. We can express this relationship with the following equation:\n\\[\np + 3p + (3p + 12) = 341\n\\]\n\n Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:\n\\[\np + 3p + 3p + 12 = 7p + 12\n\\]\n\nSo, we have:\n\\[\n7p + 12 = 341\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( p \\), we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[\n7p = 329\n\\]\n\nNext, we divide both sides by 7:\n\\[\np = 47\n\\]\n\nNow that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Smendrick has:\n\\[\n\\text{Smendrick's cards} = 3p = 3 \\times 47 = 141\n\\]\n\nAnd the number of cards Becca has:\n\\[\n\\text{Becca's cards} = 3p + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cards Becca has is \\(\\boxed{153}\\).","correct_argmax":true}

We know that the total number of coins is 110. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[\ns + (s + 30) = 110\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we get:\n\\[\n2s + 30 = 110\n\\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( s \\) by isolating the variable. First, subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[\n2s = 80\n\\]\n\nThen, divide both sides by 2:\n\\[\ns = 40\n\\]\n\nNow that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the number of gold coins by substituting \\( s \\) into the expression for the number of gold coins:\n\\[\ns + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of gold coins Gretchen has is \\(\\boxed{70}\\).","correct_argmax":true}

Since each large stuffed animal costs $4, the price of a large stuffed animal is \\( 4 \\) dollars. Therefore, the price of a small stuffed animal is \\( 3 \\times 4 = 12 \\) dollars.\n\nAccording to the problem, Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large stuffed animals. So, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \\( 2L \\).\n\nThe cost of each large stuffed animal is $4, so the total revenue from the large stuffed animals is \\( 4L \\) dollars.\nThe cost of each small stuffed animal is $12, so the total revenue from the small stuffed animals is \\( 12 \\times 2L = 24L \\) dollars.\n\nThe total revenue from both the large and small stuffed animals is given as $120. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ 4L + 24L = 120 \\]\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\\[ 28L = 120 \\]\nSolving for \\( L \\), we divide both sides by 28:\n\\[ L = \\frac{120}{28} = \\frac{30}{7} = 5 \\]\nSo, the number of large stuffed animals sold is \\( L = 5 \\).\n\nSince the number of small stuffed animals sold is \\( 2L \\), we have:\n\\[ 2L = 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).","correct_argmax":false}
