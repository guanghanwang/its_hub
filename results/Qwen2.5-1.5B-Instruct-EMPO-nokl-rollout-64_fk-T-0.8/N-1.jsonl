The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is given as 19. We can express this relationship with the following equation:\n   \\[\n   (x + 4) + x + \\frac{x}{2} = 19\n   \\]\n4. To solve this equation, first combine like terms. To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:\n   \\[\n   2(x + 4) + 2x + x = 38\n   \\]\n   Simplifying inside the parentheses and combining like terms, we get:\n   \\[\n   2x + 8 + 2x + x = 38\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   5x + 8 = 38\n   \\]\n5. Next, isolate \\( x \\) by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   5x = 30\n   \\]\n6. Solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides by 5:\n   \\[\n   x = 6\n   \\]\n7. Now that we know \\( x = 6 \\), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set. The number of balls retrieved in the first set is \\( x + 4 \\):\n   \\[\n   x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of tennis balls retrieved in the first set is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).","correct_argmax":true}
