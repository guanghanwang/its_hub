So, the total number of books is:\n\\[\n20 + 20 + 15 = 55 \\text{ books per 3-bookcases}\n\\]\nTo find out how many bookcases are needed for 110 books, we divide 110 by 55:\n\\[\n\\frac{110}{55} = 2\n\\]\nThus, Elly needs \\(\\boxed{3}\\) bookcases to hold all 110 books.","correct_argmax":false}

Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so \\( A = M \\).\n2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, so \\( C + S = 30 \\).\n3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so \\( C = S + 12 \\).\n\nSince Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, we can express their combined contribution as \\( A + M = A + A = 2A \\). Therefore, the total number of eggs painted by all four is:\n\\[ A + M + C + S = 56 \\]\nSubstituting \\( M = A \\) and \\( C = S + 12 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[ 2A + C + S = 56 \\]\nUsing \\( C = S + 12 \\), we substitute \\( C \\) in the equation:\n\\[ 2A + (S + 12) + S = 56 \\]\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\\[ 2A + 2S + 12 = 56 \\]\nSubtracting 12 from both sides, we have:\n\\[ 2A + 2S = 44 \\]\nDividing the entire equation by 2, we get:\n\\[ A + S = 22 \\]\n\nNow we have two equations:\n1. \\( C = S + 12 \\)\n2. \\( A + S = 22 \\)\n\nWe also know that \\( C + S = 30 \\). Substituting \\( C = S + 12 \\) into this equation, we get:\n\\[ S + 12 + S = 30 \\]\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \\]\nSubtracting 12 from both sides, we have:\n\\[ 2S = 18 \\]\nDividing by 2, we get:\n\\[ S = 9 \\]\nSo, \\( C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \\).\n\nNow we know \\( S = 9 \\) and \\( C = 21 \\). Using \\( A + S = 22 \\), we substitute \\( S = 9 \\):\n\\[ A + 9 = 22 \\]\nSubtracting 9 from both sides, we get:\n\\[ A = 13 \\]\nSo, \\( A = 13 \\) and \\( C = 21 \\).\n\nFinally, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:\n\\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \\]\n\nThus, Camden painted \\(\\boxed{8}\\) more eggs than Arnold.","correct_argmax":true}

Since Gretchen has 70 gold coins, we can express the number of silver coins as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of gold coins} = S + 30\n   \\]\n   We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   S + 30 = 70\n   \\]\n3.

Let's denote the number of insects David found as \\( D \\). According to the problem, David found half of what Bodhi found, so we can denote the number of insects Bodhi found as \\( B \\). Therefore, we have:\n\n\\[ D = \\frac{B}{2} \\]\n\nLily found 7 more insects than David, so we can express the number of insects Lily found as:\n\n\\[ L = D + 7 \\]\n\nThe total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ L + D + B = 43 \\]\n\nSubstituting the expressions for \\( L \\) and \\( B \\) in terms of \\( D \\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ (D + 7) + D + B = 43 \\]\n\nCombining like terms, we have:\n\n\\[ 2D + 7 + B = 43 \\]\n\nSince \\( B = 2D \\), we can substitute \\( B \\) with \\( 2D \\):\n\n\\[ 2D + 7 + 2D = 43 \\]\n\\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \\]\n\nSubtracting 7 from both sides, we get:\n\n\\[ 4D = 36 \\]\n\nDividing both sides by 4, we find:\n\n\\[ D = 9 \\]\n\nNow that we know David found 9 insects, we can find Bodhi's number of insects:\n\n\\[ B = 2D = 2 \\times 9 = 18 \\]\n\nAnd Lily's number of insects is:\n\n\\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \\]\n\nThus, the number of insects Lily found is:\n\n\\[\\boxed{16}\\]","correct_argmax":true}
